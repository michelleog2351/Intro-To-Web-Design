	<!--
	In normal flow, 
	each block-level
	element (appears on a new line, causing each item to appear lower down the page than the previous one) sits on top of the next one. Since this is the default way in which browsers treat HTML elements, you do not need a CSS property to indicate that elements should appear in normal flow, but the syntax
	would be: position: static; 
	
	The paragraphs appear one
	after the other, vertically down the page.

		<h1>Layout - Normal Flow</h1>
		<h2>The Evolution of the Bicycle</h2>
		
		<p>In 1817 Baron von Drais invented a walking
		 machine that would help him get around the
		 royal gardens faster; two same-size in-line wheels, the front one steerable, mounted in a frame upon which you straddled. The device was propelled by pushing your feet against the ground, thus rolling yourself and the device forward in a sort of gliding walk.</p>
		 
		 <p>The machine became known as the Draisienne (or "hobby horse"). It was made entirely of wood. This enjoyed a short lived popularity as a fad, not being practical for transportation in any other place than a well maintained pathway such as in a park or garden.</p>
		 
		 <p>The next appearance of a two-wheeled riding machine was in 1865, whcich pedals were applied directly to the front wheel. This machine was known as the velocipede (meaning "fast foot") as well as the "bone shaker", since it's wooden structure combined with the cobblestone roads of the day made for an extremely uncomfortable ride. They also became a fad and indoor riding academies, similar to roller rinks, could be found in large cities.</p>
