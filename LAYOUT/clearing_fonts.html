	<!--
	The clear property allows you
	to say that no element (within
	the same containing element)
	should touch the left or righthand sides of a box. It can take
	the following values:
	left
	The left-hand side of the box
	should not touch any other
	elements appearing in the same
	containing element.
	right
	The right-hand side of the
	box will not touch elements
	appearing in the same containing
	element.
	both
	Neither the left nor right-hand
	sides of the box will touch
	elements appearing in the same
	containing element.
	none
	Elements can touch either side.
	In this example, the fourth
	paragraph has a class called
	clear. The CSS rule for this
	class uses the clear property
	to indicate that nothing should
	touch the left-hand side of it. The
	fourth paragraph is therefore
	moved further down the page
	so no other element touches its
	left-hand side

		<h1>The Evolution of the Bicycle</h1>

		<p class="clear">In 1817 Baron von Drais invented a walking
		 machine that would help him get around the
		 royal gardens faster; two same-size in-line wheels, the front one steerable, mounted in a frame upon which you straddled. The device was propelled by pushing your feet against the ground, thus rolling yourself and the device forward in a sort of gliding walk.</p>
		 
		 <p>The machine became known as the Draisienne (or "hobby horse"). It was made entirely of wood. This enjoyed a short lived popularity as a fad, not being practical for transportation in any other place than a well maintained pathway such as in a park or garden.</p>
		 
		 <p>The next appearance of a two-wheeled riding machine was in 1865, whcich pedals were applied directly to the front wheel. This machine was known as the velocipede (meaning "fast foot") as well as the "bone shaker", since it's wooden structure combined with the cobblestone roads of the day made for an extremely uncomfortable ride. They also became a fad and indoor riding academies, similar to roller rinks, could be found in large cities.</p>
