	 <title>Layout - Overlapping Elements</title>
	<!--
	When you use relative, fixed, or
	absolute positioning, boxes can
	overlap. If boxes do overlap, the
	elements that appear later in the
	HTML code sit on top of those
	that are earlier in the page.
	If you want to control which
	element sits on top, you can use
	the z-index property. Its value
	is a number, and the higher the
	number the closer that element
	is to the front. For example, an
	element with a z-index of 10
	will appear over the top of one
	with a z-index of 5.
	This example looks similar to
	the one on page 368, but it
	uses relative positioning for
	the <p> elements. Because
	the paragraphs are relatively
	positioned, by default they
	would appear over the top of the
	heading as the user scrolls down
	the page. To ensure that the
	<h1> element stays on top, we
	use the z-index property on the
	rule for the <h1> element.
	The z-index is sometimes
	referred to as the stacking
	context (as if the blocks have
	been stacked on top of each
	other on a z axis). If you are
	familiar with desktop publishing
	packages, it is the equivalent
	of using the 'bring to front' and
	'send to back' features.

		<h1>The Evolution of the Bicycle</h1>
		
		<p>In 1817 Baron von Drais invented a walking
		 machine that would help him get around the
		 royal gardens faster; two same-size in-line wheels, the front one steerable, mounted in a frame upon which you straddled. The device was propelled by pushing your feet against the ground, thus rolling yourself and the device forward in a sort of gliding walk.</p>
		 
		 <p id="example">The machine became known as the Draisienne (or "hobby horse"). It was made entirely of wood. This enjoyed a short lived popularity as a fad, not being practical for transportation in any other place than a well maintained pathway such as in a park or garden.</p>
		 
		 <p>The next appearance of a two-wheeled riding machine was in 1865, whcich pedals were applied directly to the front wheel. This machine was known as the velocipede (meaning "fast foot") as well as the "bone shaker", since it's wooden structure combined with the cobblestone roads of the day made for an extremely uncomfortable ride. They also became a fad and indoor riding academies, similar to roller rinks, could be found in large cities.</p>
