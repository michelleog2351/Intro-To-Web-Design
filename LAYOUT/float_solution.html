	 <title>Layout - Parents of Floated Elements: Solution</title>
	<!--
	Traditionally, developers got
	around this problem by adding
	an extra element after the
	last floated box (inside the
	containing element). A CSS
	rule would be applied to this
	additional element setting the
	clear property to have a value
	of both. But this meant that an
	extra element was added to the
	HTML just to fix the height of the
	containing element.
	
	More recently, developers have
	opted for a purely CSS-based
	solution because it means that
	there is no need to add an extra
	element to the HTML page after
	the floated elements. The pure
	CSS solution adds two CSS rules
	to the containing element (in this
	example the <div> element):
	● The overflow property is
	given a value auto.
	● The width property is set to
	100%

		div {
			border: 1px solid #665544;
			overflow: auto;
			width: 100%;}

		<h1>The Evolution of the Bicycle</h1>
		
		<div>
		<p>In 1817 Baron von Drais invented a walking
		 machine that would help him get around the
		 royal gardens faster; two same-size in-line wheels, the front one steerable, mounted in a frame upon which you straddled. The device was propelled by pushing your feet against the ground, thus rolling yourself and the device forward in a sort of gliding walk.</p>
		 
		 <p>The machine became known as the Draisienne (or "hobby horse"). It was made entirely of wood. This enjoyed a short lived popularity as a fad, not being practical for transportation in any other place than a well maintained pathway such as in a park or garden.</p>
		 
		 <p>The next appearance of a two-wheeled riding machine was in 1865, whcich pedals were applied directly to the front wheel. This machine was known as the velocipede (meaning "fast foot") as well as the "bone shaker", since it's wooden structure combined with the cobblestone roads of the day made for an extremely uncomfortable ride. They also became a fad and indoor riding academies, similar to roller rinks, could be found in large cities.</p>
