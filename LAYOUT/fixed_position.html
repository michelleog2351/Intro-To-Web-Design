	 <title>Layout - Fixed Position</title>
	<!--
	Fixed positioning is a type
	of absolute positioning that
	requires the position property
	to have a value of fixed.
	It positions the element in
	relation to the browser window.
	Therefore, when a user scrolls
	down the page, it stays in the
	exact same place. It is a good
	idea to try this example in your
	browser to see the effect.
	To control where the fixed
	position box appears in relation
	to the browser window, the box
	offset properties are used.
	In this example, the heading
	has been positioned to the top
	left hand corner of the browser
	window. When the user scrolls
	down the page, the paragraphs
	disappear behind the heading.
	The <p> elements are in normal
	flow and ignore the space that
	the <h1> element would have
	taken up. Therefore, the
	margin-top property has
	been used to push the first <p>
	element below where the fixed
	position <h1> element is sitting.
	-->

		<h1>The Evolution of the Bicycle</h1>
		
		<p>In 1817 Baron von Drais invented a walking
		 machine that would help him get around the
		 royal gardens faster; two same-size in-line wheels, the front one steerable, mounted in a frame upon which you straddled. The device was propelled by pushing your feet against the ground, thus rolling yourself and the device forward in a sort of gliding walk.</p>
		 
		 <p id="example">The machine became known as the Draisienne (or "hobby horse"). It was made entirely of wood. This enjoyed a short lived popularity as a fad, not being practical for transportation in any other place than a well maintained pathway such as in a park or garden.</p>
		 
		 <p>The next appearance of a two-wheeled riding machine was in 1865, whcich pedals were applied directly to the front wheel. This machine was known as the velocipede (meaning "fast foot") as well as the "bone shaker", since it's wooden structure combined with the cobblestone roads of the day made for an extremely uncomfortable ride. They also became a fad and indoor riding academies, similar to roller rinks, could be found in large cities.</p>
