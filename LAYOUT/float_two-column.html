	 <title>Layout - Creating Two-Column Layout With Floats</title>
	<!--
	Many web pages use multiple
	columns in their design. This
	is achieved by using a <div>
	element to represent each
	column. The following three CSS
	properties are used to position
	the columns next to each other:
	width
	This sets the width of the
	columns.
	float
	This positions the columns next
	to each other.
	margin
	This creates a gap between the
	columns.
	A two-column layout like the one
	shown on this page would need
	two <div> elements, one for the
	main content of the page and
	one for the sidebar.
	Inside each of the <div>
	elements there can be headings,
	paragraphs, images, and even
	other <div> elements.

		<h1>The Evolution of the Bicycle</h1>
		
		<div class="column1of3">
			<h3>The First Bicycle</h3>
			<p>In 1817 Baron von Drais invented a walking
			 machine that would help him get around the
			 royal gardens faster; two same-size in-line wheels, the front one steerable, mounted in a frame upon which you straddled. The device was propelled by pushing your feet against the ground, thus rolling yourself and the device forward in a sort of gliding walk.</p>
			 
			 <p>The machine became known as the Draisienne (or "hobby horse"). It was made entirely of wood. This enjoyed a short lived popularity as a fad, not being practical for transportation in any other place than a well maintained pathway such as in a park or garden.</p>
		 </div>
		 
		 <div class="column2of3">
			<h3>Bicycle Timeline</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>1817: Draisienne</li>
				<li>1865: Velocipede</li>
				<li>1870: High-wheel bicycle</li>
				<li>1876: High-wheel safety</li>
				<li>1885: Hard-tired safety</li>
				<li>1865: Pneumatic safety</li>
			</ul>
		</div>

			 <h3>Further Innovations</h3>
			 <p>The next appearance of a two-wheeled riding machine was in 1865, whcich pedals were applied directly to the front wheel. This machine was known as the velocipede (meaning "fast foot") as well as the "bone shaker", since it's wooden structure combined with the cobblestone roads of the day made for an extremely uncomfortable ride. They also became a fad and indoor riding academies, similar to roller rinks, could be found in large cities.</p>
