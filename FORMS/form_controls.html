	 <title>Aligning Form Controls</title>
	<!--
	Labels for form elements are
	often different lengths, which
	means that the form controls will
	not appear in a straight line. This
	is demonstrated in the example
	on the right (without CSS applied
	to the form controls).
	In this form, each topic we ask
	the user about is placed inside
	a <div> element to ensure that
	each question appears on a new
	line. It is easier for users to fill in
	a form if the form controls are
	aligned in a straight vertical line.
	The CSS on the opposite page
	addresses this.
	If you look at where we ask
	users their gender, the two
	radio buttons each have their
	own <label> (one saying male
	and another saying female). A
	<span> element has been added
	to the title which will help align
	these controls.
	
	Each row of the form has a title
``
