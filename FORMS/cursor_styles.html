	<!--
	The cursor property allows
	you to control the type of mouse
	cursor that should be displayed
	to users.
	For example, on a form you
	might set the cursor to be a hand
	when the user hovers over it.
	Here are the most commonly
	used values for this property:
	auto
	crosshair
	default
	pointer
	move
	text
	wait
	help
	url("cursor.gif");
	You should only use these values
	to add helpful information for
	users in places they would
	expect to see that cursor. (For
	example, using a crosshair on a
	link might confuse users because
	they are not used to seeing it.)
