		<!--If there are two or more rules
			that apply to the same element,
			it is important to understand
			which will take precedence.
			
			LAST RULE
			If the two selectors are identical,
			the latter of the two will take
			precedence. Here you can see
			the second i selector takes
			precedence over the first.
			
			SPECIFICITY
			If one selector is more specific
			than the others, the more
			specific rule will take precedence
			over more general ones. In this
			example:
			h1 is more specific than *
			p b is more specific than p
			p#intro is more specific than p
			
			IMPORTANT
			You can add !important after
			any property value to indicate
			that it should be considered
			more important than other rules
			that apply to the same element.
