		Selectors indicate which
		element the rule applies to.
		The same rule can apply to
		more than one element if you
		separate the element names
		with commas.
		
		Declarations indicate how
		the elements referred to in
		the selector should be styled.
		Declarations are split into two
		parts (a property and a value),
		and are separated by a colon.
		
		<style>
