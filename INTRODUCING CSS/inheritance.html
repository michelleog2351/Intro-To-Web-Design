			<!--If you specify the font-family
			or color properties on the
			<body> element, they will apply
			to most child elements. This is
			because the value of the
			font-family property is
			inherited by child elements. It
			these properties to as many
			saves you from having to apply
			elements (and results in simpler
			style sheets).
			
			You can compare this with
			the background-color or
			border properties; they are not
			inherited by child elements. If
			these were inherited by all child
			elements then the page could
			look quite messy.
			
			You can force a lot of properties
			to inherit values from their
			parent elements by using
			inherit for the value of the
			properties. In this example, the
			<div> element with a class
			called page inherits the padding
			size from the CSS rule that
			applies to the <body> element.
