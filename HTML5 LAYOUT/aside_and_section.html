	 <title>HTML5 LAYOUT - Aside & Section</title>
	<!--
	The <aside> element has two
	purposes, depending on whether
	it is inside an <article>
	element or not.
	When the <aside> element
	is used inside an <article>
	element, it should contain
	information that is related to the
	article but not essential to its
	overall meaning. For example, a
	pullquote or glossary might be
	considered as an aside to the
	article it relates to.
	When the <aside> element is
	used outside of an <article>
	element, it acts as a container
	for content that is related to
	the entire page. For example,
	it might contain links to other
	sections of the site, a list of
	recent posts, a search box, or
	recent tweets by the author.
	
	The <section> element groups
	related content together, and
	typically each section would
	have its own heading.
	For example, on a homepage
	there may be several <section>
	elements to contain different
	sections of the page, such as
	latest news, top products, and
	newsletter signup.
	Because the <section> element
	groups related items together,
	it may contain several distinct
	<article> elements that have a
	common theme or purpose.
	Alternatively, if you have a
	page with a long article, the
	<section> element can be
	used to split the article up into
	separate sections.
	The <section> element should
	not be used as a wrapper for
	the entire page (unless the
	page only contains one distinct
	piece of content). If you want a
	containing element for the entire
	page, that job is still best left to
	the <div> element.
