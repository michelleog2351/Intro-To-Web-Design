	 <title>HTML5 LAYOUT - Article, Heading Group and Figures</title>
	<!--
	The <article> element acts as
	a container for any section of a
	page that could stand alone and
	potentially be syndicated.
	This could be an individual
	article or blog entry, a comment
	or forum post, or any other
	independent piece of content.
	If a page contains several articles
	(or even summaries of several
	articles), then each individual
	article would live inside its own
	<article> element.
	The <article> elements can
	even be nested inside each
	other. For example, a blog post
	might live inside one <article>
	element and each comment on
	the article could live inside its
	own child <article> element.
	
	The purpose of the <hgroup>
	element is to group together a
	set of one or more <h1> through
	<h6> elements so that they are
	treated as one single heading.
	
	For example, the <hgroup>
	element could be used to contain
	both a title inside an <h2>
	element and a subtitle within an
	<h3> element.
	
	You already met the <figure>
	element in Chapter 5 when we
	looked at images. It can be used
	to contain any content that is
	referenced from the main flow of
	an article (not just images).
	It is important to note that the
	article should still make sense
	if the content of the <figure>
	element were moved (to another
	part of the page, or even to a
	different page altogether).
	For this reason, it should only be
	used when the content simply
	references the element (and not
	for something that is absolutely
	integral to the flow of a page).
	Examples of usage include:
	● Images
	● Videos
	● Graphs
	● Diagrams
	● Code samples
	● Text that supports the main
	body of an article
	The <figure> element should
	also contain a <figcaption>
	element which provides a text
	decription for the content of
	the <figure> element. In
	this example, you can see a
	<figure> has been added inside
	the <article> element.
