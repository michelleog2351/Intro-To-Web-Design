	 <title>HTML5 LAYOUT - Linking</title>
	<!--
	<a></a>HTML5 allows web page authors
	to place an <a> element around
	a block level element that
	contains child elements. This
	allows you to turn an entire block
	into a link.
	This is not a new element in
	HTML5, but it was not seen as a
	correct usage of the <a> element
	in earlier versions of HTML.
	
	Older browsers that do not
	know the new HTML5 elements
	will automatically treat them as
	inline elements. Therefore, to
	help older browsers, you should
	include the line of CSS on the
	left which states which new
	elements should be rendered as
	block-level elements.
	Also, IE9 was the first version of
	Internet Explorer to allow CSS
	rules to be associated with these
	new HTML5 layout elements.
	In order to style these elements
	using earlier versions of IE, you
	need to use a simple JavaScript
	known as the HTML5 shiv or
	HTML5 shim. 
	
	You do not need to understand
	JavaScript to use it. You can
	just link to a copy that Google
	hosts on its servers. It should
	be placed inside a conditional
	comment which checks if the
	browser version is less than
	(hence the lt) IE9.
	Unfortunately, this workaround
	does require that anyone using
	IE8 or earlier versions of IE
	has JavaScript enabled in their
	browser. If they do not have
	JavaScript enabled then they will
	not be able to see the content of
	these HTML5 elements
