	 <title>HTML5 LAYOUT - Header, Footer, Nav</title>
	<!--
	The <header> and <footer>
	elements can be used for:
	● The main header or footer
	that appears at the top or
	bottom of every page on the
	site.
	● A header or footer for an
	individual <article> or
	<section> within the page.
	In this example, the <header>
	element used to contain the site
	name and the main navigation.
	The <footer> element contains
	copyright information, along
	with links to the privacy policy
	and terms and conditions.
	Each individual <article> and
	<section> element can also
	have its own <header> and
	<footer> elements to hold the
	header or footer information for
	that section within the page.
	For example, on a page with
	several blog posts, each
	individual post can be thought
	of as a separate section. The
	<header> element can therefore
	be used to contain the title and
	date of each individual post, and
	the <footer> might contain
	links to share the article on
	social networking sites.
	
	The <nav> element is used to
	contain the major navigational
	blocks on the site such as the
	primary site navigation.
	Going back to our blog example,
	if you wanted to finish an article
	with links to related blog posts,
	these would not be counted as
	major navigational blocks and
	therefore should not sit inside a
	<nav> element.
	At the time of writing, some of
	the developers that were already
	using HTML5 decided to use the
	<nav> element for the links that
	appear at the bottom of every
	page (links to things like privacy
	policy, terms and conditions
	and accessibility information).
	Whether this will be widely
	adopted is still yet to be seen.
