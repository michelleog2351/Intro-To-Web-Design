	 <title>Lists - Positioning The Marker</title>
	<!--
	Lists are indented into the page
	by default and the list-styleposition property indicates
	whether the marker should
	appear on the inside or the
	outside of the box containing the
	main points.
	This property can take one of
	two values:
	outside
	The marker sits to the left of the
	block of text. (This is the default
	behaviour if this property is not
	used.)
	inside
	The marker sits inside the box of
	text (which is indented).
	In the example shown, the width
	of the list has been limited to 150
	pixels. This ensures that the text
	wraps onto a new line so you can
	see how the value of inside sits
	the bullet inside the first line of
	text.
	A margin has been added to
	each list item so that there is a
	clear gap between each
	-->
