	<!--
	As with several of the other CSS
	properties, there is a property
	that acts as a shorthand for list
	styles. It is called list-style,
	and it allows you to express
	the markers' style, image and
	position properties in any order.
	-->
	 <style type="text/css">
		ul {
			list-style: inside circle;
			width: 300px;}
			li {
			margin: 10px 0px 0px 0px;}

		<ul>
		<li> I have great faith in fools; self-confidence
		my friends call it.</li>
		<li>All that we see or seem is but a dream within
		a dream.</li>
		<li>I would define, in brief, the poetry of words
		as the rhythmical Ncreation of Beauty.</li>
