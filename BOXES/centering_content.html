	 <title>Boxes - Centering Content</title>
	<!--
    If you want to center a box on
	the page (or center it inside
	the element that it sits in), you
	can set the left-margin and
	right-margin to auto.
	
	In order to center a box on the
	page, you need to set a width
	for the box (otherwise it will take
	up the full width of the page).
	
	Once you have specified the
	width of the box, setting the left
	and right margins to auto will
	make the browser put an equal
	gap on each side of the box. This
	centers the box on the page (or
	within the element that the box
	sits inside).
	
	The text-align property is
	inherited by child elements. You
	therefore also need to specify
	the text-align property on the
	centered box if you do not want
	the text inside it to be centered.
