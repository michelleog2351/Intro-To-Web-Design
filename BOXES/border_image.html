	 <title>Boxes - Border Images</title>
	<!--
	The border-image property
	applies an image to the border of
	any box. It takes a background
	image and slices it into nine
	pieces.
	
	Here is the image. I have
	added marks where it is
	sliced in the example,
	taking 18 pixels from each corner
	to place an entire circle in each
	corner. The corner slices are
	always placed in the four corners
	of the box, but we have a choice
	whether the sides are stretched
	or repeated.
	
	This property requires three
	pieces of information:
	1: The URL of the image
	2: Where to slice the image
	3: What to do with the straight
	edges; the possible values are:
	 stretch stretches the image
	 repeat repeats the image
	 round like repeat but if the
	tiles do not fit exactly, scales
	the tile image so they will
	The box must also have a border
	width for the image to be shown.

	The -moz-border-image
	and -webkit-border-image
	properties are not in the CSS
	specification but help earlier
	versions of Chrome, Firefox, and
	Safari display this effect.
