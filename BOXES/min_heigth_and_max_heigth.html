	 <title>Boxes - Limiting Heigth</title>
	<!--
    In the same way that you might
	want to limit the width of a box
	on a page, you may also want
	to limit the height of it. This is
	achieved using the min-height
	and max-height properties.
	
	The example on this page
	demonstrates these properties
	in action. It also shows you what
	happens when the content of the
	box takes up more space than
	the size specified for the box.
	
	If the box is not big enough to
	hold the content, and the content
	expands outside the box it can
	look very messy. To control
	what happens when there is not
	enough space for the content of
	a box, you can use the overflow
	property.
