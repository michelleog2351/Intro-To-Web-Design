	 <title>Boxes - IE6 Box Model</title>
	<!--
    When you specify the width of
	a box, any padding or margin
	should be added to the width of
	it. Internet Explorer 6, however,
	has a quirk whereby it includes
	the padding and margins in the
	width of the box.
	The way around this is to ensure
	that you provide a DOCTYPE
	declaration for the HTML page.
	(DOCTYPE declarations were
	covered on page 181.) You can
	use either the HTML5, HTML
	4 strict, or HTML 4 transitional
	DOCTYPE declarations to
	ensure that IE6 follows the
	correct box model.
