	 <title>Boxes - Padding</title>
	<!--
    The padding property allows
	you to specify how much space
	should appear between the
	content of an element and its
	border.
	
	The value of this property is
	most often specified in pixels
	(although it is also possible to
	use percentages or ems). If a
	percentage is used, the padding
	is a percentage of the browser
	window (or of the containing box
	if it is inside another box).
	
	Please note: If a width is
	specified for a box, padding is
	added onto the width of the box
	
	As you can see, the second
	paragraph here is much easier
	to read because there is a space
	between the text and the border
	of the box. The box is also wider
	because it has padding.
	
	You can specify different values
	for each side of a box using:
	padding-top
	padding-right
	padding-bottom
	padding-left
	
	Or you can use a shorthand
	(where the values are in
	clockwise order: top, right,
	bottom, left):
	
	padding: 10px 5px 3px 1px;
