	 <title>Boxes - Limiting Width</title>
	<!--
    Some page designs expand and
	shrink to fit the size of the user's
	screen. In such designs, the
	min-width property specifies
	the smallest size a box can be
	displayed at when the browser
	window is narrow, and the
	max-width property indicates
	the maximum width a box can
	stretch to when the browser
	window is wide.

	These are very helpful properties
	to ensure that the content of
	pages are legible (especially on
	the smaller screens of handheld
	devices). For example, you can
	use the max-width property to
	ensure that lines of text do not
	appear too wide within a big
	browser window and you can
	use the min-width property
	to make sure that they do not
	appear too narrow.

	You may find it helpful to try this
	example out in your browser so
	that you can see what happens
	when you increase or decrease
	the size of the browser window.
