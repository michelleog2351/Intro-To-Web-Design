	 <title>Boxes - Margin</title>
	<!--
    The margin property controls
	the gap between boxes. Its value
	is commonly given in pixels,
	although you may also use
	percentages or ems.
	If one box sits on top of another,
	margins are collapsed , which
	means the larger of the two
	margins will be used and the
	smaller will be disregarded.
	Please note: If the width of a box
	is specified then the margin is
	added to the width of the box.
	You can specify values for each
	side of a box using:
	margin-top
	margin-right
	margin-bottom
	margin-left
	You can also use the shorthand
	(where the values are in
	clockwise order: top, right,
	bottom, left):
	margin: 1px 2px 3px 4px;

	Sometimes you might see the
	following, which means that the
	left and right margins should be
	10 pixels and the top and bottom
	margins should be 20 pixels:
	margin: 10px 20px;
	(This same shorthand shown
	above can also be applied to
	padding.)

		p.example {
		margin: 20px;}
