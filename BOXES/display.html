	<!--
	display
    The display property allows
	you to turn an inline element
	into a block-level element or vice
	versa, and can also be used to
	hide an element from the page.
	The values this property can
	take are:
	
	inline
	This causes a block-level
	element to act like an inline
	element.
	
	block
	This causes an inline element to
	act like a block-level element.
	
	inline-block
	This causes a block-level
	element to flow like an inline
	element, while retaining other
	features of a block-level element.
	
	none
	This hides an element from the
	page. In this case, the element
	acts as though it is not on the
	page at all (although a user could
	still see the content of the box if
	they used the view source option
	in their browser).
	
	If you use this property, it is
	important to note that inline
	boxes are not supposed to create
	block-level elements.
	
	In this example you can see
	a list. Each item in the list is
	usually treated as a block-level
	element, but the rule for the
	<li> elements indicates that
	they should be treated as inline
	elements, which means they will
	sit alongside each other rather
	than appearing on new lines.
	
	This technique is often used to
	create navigation for a site, and
	in this example a margin has
	been added to the right of each
	of the items to separate them
	out. The rule that applies to the
	<li> element whose class is
	coming-soon has been hidden
	as if it were not in the page at all.
