	 <title>Boxes - Limiting Heigth</title>
	<!--
    The overflow property tells the
	browser what to do if the content
	contained within a box is larger
	than the box itself. It can have
	one of two values:
	hidden
	This property simply hides any
	extra content that does not fit in
	the box.
	scroll
	This property adds a scrollbar to
	the box so that users can scroll
	to see the missing content.
	On the left, you can see two
	boxes whose contents expand
	beyond their set dimensions. The
	first example has the overflow
	property with a value of hidden.
	The second example has the
	overflow property with a value
	of scroll.
	The overflow property is
	particularly handy because some
	browsers allow users to adjust
	the size of the text to appear as
	large or as small as they want. If
	the text is set too large then the
	page can become an unreadable
	mess. Hiding the overflow on
	such boxes helps prevent items
	overlapping on the page.
