			<!-- The <span> element acts like
			an inline equivalent of the <div>
			element.
			
			 most common reason why people use <span> elements is so that they can control the appearance of the content of these elements using CSS. 
			 
			 a class or id attribute is used with
			<span> elements:
			● To explain the purpose of this
			<span> element
			● So that CSS styles can be
			applied to elements that
			have specific values for these
			attributes -->
