		 <!-- The font-size property enables
			you to specify a size for the
			font. There are several ways to
			specify the size of a font. The
			most common are:

			pixels
			Pixels are commonly used
			because they allow web
			designers very precise control
			over how much space their text
			takes up. The number of pixels is
			followed by the letters px.
				- Setting font size in pixels is the
				best way to ensure that the type
				appears at the size you intended 
			
			point
			You can also use pt for point
			sizes instead of px for pixels, but
			you should only do this when
			creating style sheets for printer-friendly versions of pages.
			Print designers often refer to the
			size of text in terms of points (pt)
			rather than pixels (px).		
			
			percentages
			The default size of text in
			browsers is 16px. So a size of
			75% would be the equivalent of
			12px, and 200% would be 32px.

			ems
			An em is equivalent to the width
			of a letter m. And allow you to change the size of text relative to the size of the text in the parent element.

		 Briard">briard</a>, or berger de brie, is
		 a large breed of dog traditionally used as
		 a herder and guardian of sheep.</p>
		 
		 <h1><strong>Breed History</strong></h1>
		 <p>The briard, which is believed to have originated in france, has been bred for centuries to herd and to protect sheep. The breed was used by the French army as sentries, messengers and to search for wounded soldiers because of its fine sense of hearing. Briards were used in the First World War almost to the point of extinction. Currently the population of briards is slowly recovering. Charlemagne, Napoleon, Thomas Jefferson and Lafayette all owned briards.</p>
