		 <!-- 
		The vertical-align property is
		a common source of confusion.
		It is not intended to allow you to
		vertically align text in the middle
		of block level elements such as
		<p> and <div>, although it does
		have this effect when used with
		table cells (the <td> and <th>
		elements).
		
		It is more commonly used with
		inline elements such as <img>,
		<em>, or <strong> elements.
		When used with these elements,
		it performs a task very similar to
		the HTML align attribute used
		on the <img> element, which
		you met on pages 103-106. The
		values it can take are:
		
		baseline
		sub
		super
		top
		text-top
		middle
		bottom
		text-bottom
		
		It can also take a length (usually
		specified in pixels or ems) or a
		percentage of the line height.-->
