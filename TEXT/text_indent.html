		<title>Text - Indenting Text</title>
	 <style type="text/css">

		 <!-- 
		The text-indent property
		allows you to indent the first
		line of text within an element.
		The amount you want the line
		indented by can be specified in
		a number of ways but is usually
		given in pixels or ems.
		
		It can take a negative value,
		which means it can be used
		to push text off the browser
		window. You can see this
		technique used in this example,
		where the <h1> element uses a
		background image to represent
		the heading. The text has been
		moved far to the left, off the
		screen. (Background images are
		covered on pagess 413-418.)
		
		We still want the heading text
		to be on the page (for search
		engines and those who cannot
		see the image), but we cannot
		have it displayed on top of the
		logo or it will be unreadable. By
		pushing it 9,999 pixels to the
		left, it is way out of sight but still
		in the HTML code.
		The second rule in this example
		indents the credits 20 pixels to
		the right.-->

		 <h1><strong>Briards</strong></h1>
		 <p class="credits">by Ivy Duckett</p>
		 <p class="intro">The <a class="breed" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Briard">briard</a>, or berger de brie, is a large breed of dog traditionally used as
		 a herder and guardian of sheep.</p>
		 
		 <h2><strong>Breed History</strong></h2>
		 <p class="briard">The briard, which is believed to have originated in France, has been bred for centuries to herd and to protect sheep. The breed was used by the French army as sentries, messengers and to search for wounded soldiers because of its fine sense of hearing. Briards were used in the First World War almost to the point of extinction. Currently the population of briards is slowly recovering. Charlemagne, Napoleon, Thomas Jefferson and Lafayette all owned briards.</p>
