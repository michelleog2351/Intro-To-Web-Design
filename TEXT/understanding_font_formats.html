	 <style type="text/css">
 
		 <!-- Different browsers support
			different formats for fonts
			(in the same way that they
			support different audio and
			video formats), so you will need
			to supply the font in several
			variations to reach all browsers.
			
			If you do not have all of these
			formats for your font, you can
			upload the font to a website
			called FontSquirrel where they
			will convert it for you:
			
			www.fontsquirrel.com/
			fontface/generator
			
			Font Squirrel also provides you
			with the CSS code for the
			@font-face rule. This is very
			helpful because, when you
			are dealing with multiple font
			formats, the src and format
			properties of the @font-face
			rule can get rather complicated.
			
			The various font formats should
			appear in your code in this order:
			1: eot
			2: woff
			3: ttf/otf
			4: svg-->
			@font-face {
			font-family: 'ChunkFiveRegular';
			src: url('fonts/chunkfive.eot');
			src: url('fonts/chunkfive.eot?#iefix')
			 format('embedded-opentype'),
			 url('fonts/chunkfive.woff') format('woff'),
			 url('fonts/chunkfive.ttf')
			 format('truetype'),
			 url('fonts/chunkfive.svg#ChunkFiveRegular')
			 format('svg');}

		 Briard">briard</a>, or berger de brie, is
		 a large breed of dog traditionally used as
		 a herder and guardian of sheep.</p>
		 
		 <h1><strong>Breed History</strong></h1>
		 <p>The briard, which is believed to have originated in france, has been bred for centuries to herd and to protectsheep. The breed was used by the French army as sentries, messengers and to search for wounded soldiers because of its fine sense of hearing. Briards were used in the First World War almost to the point of extinction. Currently the population of briards is slowly recovering. Charlemagne, Napoleon, Thomas Jefferson and Lafayette all owned briards.</p>
