		 <!-- 
		Kerning is the term
		typographers use for the space
		between each letter. You can
		control the space between each
		letter with the letter-spacing
		property.
		
		It is particularly helpful to
		increase the kerning when
		your heading or sentence is
		all in uppercase. If your text is
		in sentence (or normal) case,
		increasing or decreasing the
		kerning can make it harder to
		read.
		
		You can also control the gap
		between words using the
		word-spacing property.
		When you specify a value for
		these properties, it should
		be given in ems, and it will be
		added on top of the default value
		specified by the font.
		
		The default gap between
		words is set by the typeface
		(often around 0.25em), and
		it is unlikely that you would
		need to change this property
		regularly. If the typeface is bold
		or you have increased the space
		between letters, then a larger
		gap between words can increase
		
		readability.-->

		 <p class="intro">The <a class="breed" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Briard">briard</a>, or berger de brie, is a large breed of dog traditionally used as
		 a herder and guardian of sheep.</p>
		 
		 <h2><strong>Breed History</strong></h2>
		 <p class="briard">The briard, which is believed to have originated in France, has been bred for centuries to herd and to protect sheep. The breed was used by the French army as sentries, messengers and to search for wounded soldiers because of its fine sense of hearing. Briards were used in the First World War almost to the point of extinction. Currently the population of briards is slowly recovering. Charlemagne, Napoleon, Thomas Jefferson and Lafayette all owned briards.</p>
