		<!-- 
		You can specify different values
		for the first letter or first line of
		text inside an element using
		:first-letter and
		:first-line.
		
		Technically these are not
		properties. They are known as
		pseudo-elements.
		You specify the pseudo-element
		at the end of the selector, and
		then specify the declarations as
		you would normally for any other
		element.
		
		CSS introduces both pseudoelements and pseudo-classes.
		A pseudo-element acts like an
		extra element is in the code. In
		the case of the :first-letter
		and :first-line pseudo
		elements, it is as if there is an
		extra element around the first
		letter or the first line which can
		have its own styles applied.
		A pseudo-class acts like an
		extra value for a class attribute.
		In the case of the :visited
		pseudo-class, which you meet
		on the next page, it allows you
		to have different styles for links
		that have been visited. Similarly,
		the :hover pseudo-class allows
		you to style elements differently
		when a user hovers over them.-->

		 <h1><strong>Briards</strong></h1>

		 <p class="intro">The <a class="breed" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Briard">briard</a>, or berger de brie, is a large breed of dog traditionally used as
		 a herder and guardian of sheep.</p>
		 
		 <h2><strong>Breed History</strong></h2>
		 <p>The briard, which is believed to have originated in france, has been bred for centuries to herd and to protect sheep. The breed was used by the French army as sentries, messengers and to search for wounded soldiers because of its fine sense of hearing. Briards were used in the First World War almost to the point of extinction. Currently the population of briards is slowly recovering. Charlemagne, Napoleon, Thomas Jefferson and Lafayette all owned briards.</p>
