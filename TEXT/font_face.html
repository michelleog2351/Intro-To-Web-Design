		 <!-- @font-face allows you to use
			a font, even if it is not installed
			on the computer of the person
			browsing, by allowing you to
			specify a path to a copy of the
			font, which will be downloaded if
			it is not on the user's machine.
			
			Because this technique allows
			a version of the font to be
			downloaded to the user's
			computer, it is important that the
			license for the font permits it to
			be used in this way. 
			
			There are some sites that give
			you access to use commercial
			fonts, because they negotiated
			permission to let their customers
			use these fonts for a fee:
			www.typekit.com
			www.kernest.com
			www.fontspring.com
			
			Google also provides open
			source fonts. Rather than adding
			the @font-face rule to your own
			style sheet, you link to a CSS file
			and font files on their servers:
			www.google.com/webfonts-->

			font-family
			This specifies the name of the

			as a value of the font-family
			property in the rest of the style

			src: url('fonts/chunkfive.eot');} 
			<!-- src...This specifies the path to the font. -->

		 Briard">briard</a>, or berger de brie, is
		 a large breed of dog traditionally used as
		 a herder and guardian of sheep.</p>
		 
		 <h1><strong>Breed History</strong></h1>
		 <p>The briard, which is believed to have originated in france, has been bred for centuries to herd and to protect sheep. The breed was used by the French army as sentries, messengers and to search for wounded soldiers because of its fine sense of hearing. Briards were used in the First World War almost to the point of extinction. Currently the population of briards is slowly recovering. Charlemagne, Napoleon, Thomas Jefferson and Lafayette all owned briards.</p>
