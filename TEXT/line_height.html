		 <!-- 
		Leading (pronounced ledding) is
		a term typographers use for the
		vertical space between lines of
		text. 
		
		In a typeface, the part of
		a letter that drops beneath the
		baseline is called a descender,
		while the highest point of a letter
		is called the ascender. 
		
		Leading is measured from the bottom of
		the descender on one line to the
		top of the ascender on the next.

		In CSS, the line-height
		property sets the height of
		an entire line of text, so the
		difference between the fontsize and the line-height is
		equivalent to the leading (as
		shown in the diagram above).
		
		Increasing the line-height
		makes the vertical gap between
		lines of text larger-->

		 a herder and guardian of sheep.</p>
		 
		 <h2><strong>Breed History</strong></h2>
		 <p class="briard">The briard, which is believed to have originated in France, has been bred for centuries to herd and to protect sheep. The breed was used by the French army as sentries, messengers and to search for wounded soldiers because of its fine sense of hearing. Briards were used in the First World War almost to the point of extinction. Currently the population of briards is slowly recovering. Charlemagne, Napoleon, Thomas Jefferson and Lafayette all owned briards.</p>
