		There are three pseudo-classes
		that allow you to change the
		appearance of elements when a
		user is interacting with them.
		
		:hover
		This is applied when a user
		hovers over an element with a
		pointing device such as a mouse.
		This has commonly been used
		to change the appearance of
		links and buttons when a user
		places their cursor over them. It
		is worth noting that such events
		do not work on devices that use
		touch screens (such as the iPad)
		because the screen is not able to
		tell when someone is hovering
		their finger over an element.
		
		:active
		This is applied when an element
		is being activated by a user; for
		example, when a button is being
		pressed or a link being clicked.
		Sometimes this is used to make
		a button or link feel more like it
		is being pressed by changing the
		style or position of the element
		slightly.
		
		:focus
		This is applied when an element
		has focus. Any element that
		you can interact with, such as a
		link you can click on or any form
		control can have focus.
		
		Focus occurs when a browser
		discovers that you are ready to
		interact with an element on the
		page. For example, when your
		cursor is in a form input ready
		to accept typing, that element
		is said to have focus. It is also
		possible to use the tab key on
		your keyboard to move through
		the interactive items on a page.
		When pseudo-classes are
		used, they should appear in this
		order: :link, :visited, :hover,
		:focus, :active.-->
