		<!--CSS treats each HTML element
			as if it appears in a box, and the
			background-color property
			sets the color of the background
			for that box.
			
			You can specify your choice of
			background color in the same
			three ways you can specify
			foreground colors: RGB values,
			hex codes, and color names
			(covered on the next page).
			
			If you do not specify a
			background color, then the
			background is transparent.

			By default, most browser
			windows have a white
			background, but browser users
			can set a background color for
			their windows, so if you want
			to be sure that the background
			is white you can use the
			background-color property on
			the <body> element.-->

		<h2>The Composition of Seawater</h2>
		<p>Almost anything csn be found in seawater. This includes dissolved materials from Earth's crust as well as materials released from organisms. The most important components of seawater that influence life forms are salinity, temperature, dissolved gases (mostly oxygen and carbon dioxide), nutrients and pH. These elements vary in their composition as well as in theur influence on marine life.</p>
