	 <title>CSS3 - GRADIENTS (BACKGROUND IMAGE)</title>
	<!--
	CSS3 is going to introduce the
	ability to specify a gradient for
	the background of a box. The
	gradient is created using the
	background-image property
	and, at the time of writing,
	different browsers required a
	different syntax.
	Since it is not supported by all
	browsers, it is possible to specify
	a background image for the box
	first (which would represent the
	gradient) and then provide the
	CSS alternatives for browsers
	that support gradients.
	On this page, we are focusing
	on linear gradients. You can see
	that in order to create a linear
	gradient, we need to specify
	two colors (that the gradient is
	between).
	Some browsers allow you
	to specify the angle of the
	gradient, or even different types
	of gradients (such as radial
	gradients), but support is not
	as widespread as that for linear
	gradients.
