	 <title>Aligning Images Using CSS</title>
	<!--
	Rather than using the <img>
	element's align attribute, web
	page authors are increasingly
	using the float property to align
	images. There are two ways that
	this is commonly achieved:
	1: The float property is added
	to the class that was created to
	represent the size of the image
	(such as the small class in our
	example).
	2: New classes are created with
	names such as align-left or
	align-right to align the images
	to the left or right of the page.
	These class names are used in
	addition to classes that indicate
	the size of the image.
	In this example you can see the
	align-left and align-right
	classes used to align the image.
	It is also common to add a
	margin to the image to ensure
	that the text does not touch their edges.

		 <b><i>Magnolia</i></b> is a large genus that contains over 200 flowering plant species. It is named after french botanist Pierre Magnol, and having evolved before bees appeared the flowers were developed to encourage pollination by beetles.

		 Some mangolias, such as <i>Magnolia stellata</i> and <i>Magnolia soulangeana</i>, flower quite early in the spring before the leaves open. Others flower in late spring or early summer, such as <i>Magnolia grandiflora.</i></p>
