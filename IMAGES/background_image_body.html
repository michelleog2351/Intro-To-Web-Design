	 <title>Background Images - Entire Body</title>
	<!--
	The background-image
	property allows you to place
	an image behind any HTML
	element. This could be the entire
	page or just part of the page. By
	default, a background image will
	repeat to fill the entire box.
	The path to the image follows
	the letters url, and it is put
	inside parentheses and quotes.

	In this example, you can
	see a background image being
	applied to an entire page
	(because the CSS selector
	applies to the <body> element).
	In the second example, the
	background image just applies to
	a paragraph.
	If you search online, you will
	find lots of resources that offer
	background textures that you
	can use on your pages.
	
	Background images are often
	the last thing on the page to
	load (which can make a website
	seem slow to load). As with any
	images you use online, if the
	size of the file is large it will take longer to download.
