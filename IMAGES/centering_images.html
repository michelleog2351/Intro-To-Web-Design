	 <title>Centering Images Using CSS</title>
	<!--
	By default, images are inline
	elements. This means that they
	flow within the surrounding text.
	In order to center an image, it
	should be turned into a blocklevel element using the display
	property with a value of block.
	Once it has been made into a
	block-level element, there are
	two common ways in which you
	can horizontally center an image:
	1: On the containing element,
	you can use the text-align
	property with a value of center.
	2: On the image itself, you can
	use the use the margin property
	and set the values of the left and
	right margins to auto.
	You can specify class names
	that allow any element to be
	centered, in the same way that
	you can for the dimensions or
	alignment of images.
