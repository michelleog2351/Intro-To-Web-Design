	<!--
	Using CSS, it is possible to create
	a link or button that changes to a
	second style when a user moves
	their mouse over it (known as a
	rollover) and a third style when
	they click on it.
	This is achieved by setting a
	background image for the link or
	button that has three different
	styles of the same button (but
	only allows enough space to
	show one of them at a time).
	You can see the image we are
	using in this example on the
	right. It actually features two
	buttons on the one image.
	When the user moves their
	mouse over the element, or
	clicks on it, the position of the
	background image is moved to
	show the relevant image.
	When a single image is used
	for several different parts of an
	interface, it is known as a sprite.
	You can add the logo and other
	interface elements, as well as
	buttons to the image.
	The advantage of using sprites is
	that the web browser only needs
	to request one image rather than
	many images, which can make
	the web page load faster.
	
	In this example, you can see two
	links that look like buttons. Each
	of the buttons has three different
	states. These are all represented
	in a single image.
	Because the <a> element is
	an inline element, we set the
	display property of these links
	to indicate that they should be
	inline-block elements. This
	allows us to specify the width
	and height of each <a> element
	so that it matches the size of its
	corresponding button.
	The background-position
	property is used to move the
	image in order to show the
	button in the right state.
	When the user hovers over a
	link, the :hover pseudo-class
	has a rule that moves the
	background-position of the
	image to show a different state
	for that button.
	Similarly, when the user clicks on
	the link, the :active pseudoclass has a rule to show the third
	state for that button.
