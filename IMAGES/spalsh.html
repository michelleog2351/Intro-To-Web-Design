<!-- Create a CSS file named "styles.css" (or use inline styles if preferred) and link it to your HTML file.

Define the styles for the splash container and the background image in your CSS file:


Customize the .splash-content class to suit your needs, such as adding text, images, or other elements within the splash container.

Adjust the background image path in the CSS to point to the location of your desired image. Make sure the image file is in the same directory or provide the correct path relative to the CSS file.

Save both the HTML and CSS files in the same directory and open the HTML file in a web browser to see the dark background image splash.

Remember to replace 'path/to/your/image.jpg' with the actual path to your background image file. Additionally, you can modify the styles as per your requirements to achieve the desired appearance.-->
