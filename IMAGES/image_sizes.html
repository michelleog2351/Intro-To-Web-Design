	<!--
	You can control the size of an
	image using the width and
	height properties in CSS, just
	like you can for any other box.
	Specifying image sizes helps
	pages to load more smoothly
	because the HTML and CSS
	code will often load before the
	images, and telling the browser
	how much space to leave for an
	image allows it to render the rest
	of the page without waiting for
	the image to download.
	You might think that your site
	is likely to have images of all
	different sizes, but a lot of sites
	use the same sized image across
	many of their pages.
	For example, an e-commerce site
	tends to show product photos
	at the same size. Or, if your site
	is designed on a grid, then you
	might have a selection of image
	sizes that are commonly used on
	all pages, such as:
	Small portrait: 220 x 360
	Small landscape: 330 x 210
	Feature photo: 620 x 400
	Whenever you use consistently
	sized images across a site,
	you can use CSS to control
	the dimensions of the
	images, instead of putting the
	dimensions in the HTML.
	
	First you need to determine the
	sizes of images that will be used
	commonly throughout the site,
	then give each size a name.
	For example:
	small
	medium
	large
	Where the <img> elements
	appear in the HTML, rather
	than using width and height
	attributes you can use these
	names as values for the class
	attribute.
	In the CSS, you add selectors for
	each of the class names, then
	use the CSS width and height
	properties to control the image
	dimensions.
