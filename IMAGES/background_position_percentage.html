	 <title>Repeating Images - Background Position Percentage</title>
	<!--
	When an image is not being
	repeated, you can use the
	background-position
	property to specify where in the
	browser window the background
	image should be placed.
	This property usually has a pair
	of values. The first represents
	the horizontal position and the
	second represents the vertical.
	 left top
	 left center
	 left bottom
	 center top
	 center center
	 center bottom
	 right top
	 right center
	 right bottom
	If you only specify one value,
	the second value will default to
	center.
	
	You can also use a pair of pixels
	or percentages. These represent
	the distance from the top left
	corner of the browser window
	(or containing box). The top left
	corner is equal to 0% 0%. The
	example shown, with values of
	50% 50%, centers the image
	horizontally and vertically.
